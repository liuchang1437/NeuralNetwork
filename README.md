# Neural Network
## Multilayer Quadratic Perceptron

+ It's an implementation of **MLQP**. The activation function is
  + $$y_i = sigmoid(\sum_i (u_{ji}y_i^2+v_{ji}y_i) +b_j)$$
+ Run it simply by `python network.py`
+ It can execute in either on-line mode or batch mode. You can switch it in  `network.py`
